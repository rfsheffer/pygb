PyGB
=============
A Gameboy emulator written in Python

Current Progress
-------
* Memory Space, mapped out, with tests for special echo space

Reasons for creating this project
-------
* To learn how to write a hardware emulator, but not go too crazy
* Gain a powerful perspective about how things were done in the past
* I appreciate this piece of hardware a lot, and played the hell out of it as a kid
* General Python Practice
