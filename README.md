PyGB
=============
A GameBoy emulator written in Python

Current Progress
-------
* Memory Space, mapped out, with tests for special echo space
* Load and describe a rom

Current Stage
-------
I am currently working on the special memory bank controllers such as MBC1-MBCn

Reasons for creating this project
-------
* To learn how to write a hardware emulator, but not go too crazy
* Gain a powerful perspective about how things were done in the past
* I appreciate this piece of hardware a lot, and played the hell out of it as a kid
* General Python Practice

How to Run
-------
* Clone this repository
* Run python3 main.py --rom "Path to the rom you want to run"
